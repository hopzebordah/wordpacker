# wordpacker
a java program that encodes strings by packing their ascii values into longs/ints

this is an eclipse project directory, so if you use eclipse, then just download and import the folder

otherwise, this program can be executed from the command line by navigating to the parent directory and running:

java com.ske.Main

I plan to add functionality that will allow a user to provide a text file to be encoded/decoded by the program
